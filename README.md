# Material
Make notifications better-ish agian!

Material does a couple things:

* Makes notifications transparent.
* Fixes ColorBanners/Unify corners support.
* Adds more lines to notifications cells. (Works with Unify)

# Bugs 🐜

1. Transparent CC.
2. Transparent Widgets.

Both of these will be fixed by tonight. I know why they happen.
